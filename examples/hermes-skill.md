# Garmin MCP Skill

Use this skill whenever a user asks Hermes to inspect Garmin activity, sleep, heart-rate, HRV, stress, Body Battery, training readiness, daily summaries or weekly summaries through the Garmin MCP.

## Rules

- Start with `mcp_garmin_garmin_connection_status`.
- If tokens are missing, ask the user to run `garmin-mcp-server auth --install-helper` locally.
- Prefer `mcp_garmin_garmin_daily_summary` and `mcp_garmin_garmin_weekly_summary` before low-level endpoint calls.
- Treat Garmin data as sensitive. Do not request raw payloads unless the user explicitly asks.
- Explain that this is unofficial Garmin Connect personal mode and can break if Garmin changes private auth or endpoints.
- Do not diagnose or treat medical conditions.
- Reload MCP with `/reload-mcp` or `hermes mcp test garmin`; do not restart the gateway for normal data access.
