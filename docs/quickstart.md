# Garmin MCP Quickstart

## 1. Install setup

```bash
npx -y garmin-mcp-unofficial setup
```

This creates local MCP configuration only. It does not ask for your Garmin password.

For Hermes:

```bash
npx -y garmin-mcp-unofficial setup --client hermes
```

## 2. Connect Garmin locally

```bash
npx -y garmin-mcp-unofficial auth --install-helper
```

The helper prompts locally for Garmin email, password and MFA when needed. The MCP does not store your Garmin password.

If Python package installation is blocked by Homebrew or PEP 668, the helper creates an isolated virtualenv under `~/.garmin-mcp/venv` automatically.

## 3. Check readiness

```bash
npx -y garmin-mcp-unofficial doctor
```

## 4. Ask your agent

Start with:

```text
Call garmin_connection_status. If ready, call garmin_daily_summary with response_format=json and give me today's main recovery/training signal with 3 practical actions. Do not provide medical diagnosis.
```

## Notes

Garmin MCP is unofficial. It uses personal Garmin Connect token mode, not official Garmin Health API partner access.

You do not need to create a Garmin developer app, client ID, client secret or redirect URL for this personal local mode.
