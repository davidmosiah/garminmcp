# Changelog

## 0.4.1 - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **Profile-store regex no longer false-positives on common wellness words.** Split `SECRET_PATTERNS` into `SECRET_KEY_PATTERNS` (broad, for field names like `oauth_token`) and `SECRET_VALUE_PATTERNS` (high-specificity, only credential shapes: JWTs, `Bearer <token>`, `sk_live_`, `sk-proj-`, `xoxb-`, `github_pat_`, raw `Authorization:` headers). Previously legitimate text like "5 training sessions per week", "limit cookies", "I need to refresh my approach", or "secret sauce: more sleep" was rejected.
- **Partial-profile reads no longer crash downstream.** `readProfileFile` now structurally merges with `DEFAULT_PROFILE` when legacy Hermes/OpenClaw files lacked sub-objects (goals, devices, training, nutrition, preferences, safety). Previously `buildProfileSummary` and `missingCriticalFields` would throw.
- **Onboarding `privacy_note` no longer hard-codes a single connector path.** Lists multiple example paths so the message reads correctly from every connector.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-05-11

- Add shared Delx wellness profile support, vendored from `delx-wellness/lib/profile-store.ts` into `src/services/profile-store.ts` (no new npm deps; Node built-ins only).
- Add `garmin_profile_get` tool — read the shared profile (`~/.delx-wellness/profile.json`), returns summary, missing_critical fields and storage_path. Read-only.
- Add `garmin_profile_update` tool — patch the shared profile; requires `explicit_user_intent=true`. Rejects any field that looks like a secret (oauth/token/secret/password/cookie/refresh/api_key/session).
- Add `garmin_onboarding` tool — return the 11-question onboarding flow (`en` or `pt-BR`) plus current profile state and missing critical fields. Read-only.
- Add `garmin-mcp-server onboarding` CLI command — print the onboarding flow JSON (and a TTY-friendly Markdown summary when stderr is a TTY).
- `recommended_first_calls` now leads with `garmin_profile_get` so agents check the shared profile state before walking quickstart.
- Auto-migration from Hermes (`~/.hermes/profiles/delx-wellness/wellness-profile.json`) and OpenClaw (`~/.openclaw-delx-wellness/workspace/wellness-profile.json`) legacy paths to the canonical `~/.delx-wellness/profile.json`.
- Tool count: 38 → 41.

## 0.1.4

- Fixed agent-facing docs links to use `https://garminconnectmcp.vercel.app/`.
- Made new Hermes setup configs include `approvals.mcp_reload_confirm: false` by default.
- Expanded HTTP smoke coverage to exercise the real MCP `/mcp` protocol, not only `/health`.

## 0.1.3

- Made `setup` non-interactive with respect to Garmin login by default; use `setup --auth` to start auth immediately.
- Actually added automatic isolated Python venv fallback for Garmin auth helper when Homebrew Python blocks `pip --user` installs.
- Added CLI regression coverage so smoke tests do not depend on a real local Garmin token.

## 0.1.2

- Added automatic isolated Python venv fallback for Garmin auth helper when Homebrew Python blocks pip --user installs.

## 0.1.1

- Updated public docs URL to https://garminconnectmcp.vercel.app after Vercel alias assignment.

## 0.1.0

- Initial Garmin MCP Unofficial release.

- Added daily and weekly agent summaries with data-quality confidence and non-medical action candidates.
- Added privacy modes, token redaction, optional SQLite cache, local doctor checks and Hermes integration guidance.
- Added static documentation and Vercel landing page.
